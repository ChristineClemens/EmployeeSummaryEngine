Christine Clemens - Eighth Homework Submission for SCS Boot Coding

### User Story
*AS A* manager,     
*I WANT* to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info     
*SO THAT* I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles. 

### Objective
The objective of this assignment was to complete the app.js file in order to build an effective software engineering team generator command line application. This application is intended to prompt the user for information about the team manager as well as those working under the team manager. The challenge is to build a node.js CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. 

### I was required to:
* Create a functional application that collects information about each employee.
* Compile an organized, appropriately named GitHub repository.
* Complete a README.md file that accurately describes the project.
* Complete the app.js file to allow users to generate an HTML file that displays information about their team.
* All tests must pass.
* Include the following classes: Employee, Manager, Engineer, Intern.
* Include the following properties and methods in the Employee parent class: name, id, email, getName(), getID(), getEmail(), getRole().
* Extend the Employee class for Manager to include: officeNumber, getRole().
* Extend the Employee class for the Engineer to include: github, getGithub(), getRole().
* Extend the Employee class for the Intern to include: school, getSchool(), getRole().
* Prompt the user to select and input correct information.
